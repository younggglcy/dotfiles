# Claude Code Guidelines

## Language
- All commit messages, code comments, and documentation in **English**

## Creating npm Libraries
- Use `cnl` CLI to scaffold new npm libraries
- `cnl` is provided by [`@younggglcy/create-npm-lib`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@younggglcy/create-npm-lib), source code at `~/projects/create-npm-lib`
- If `cnl` needs improvement, submit PRs to that repository instead of working around it

## Philosophy: Slow is Fast
Prioritize:
- **Reasoning quality** over quick answers
- **Abstraction & architecture** over shortcuts
- **Long-term maintainability** over short-term speed

Take time to think deeply. A well-considered solution saves more time than a rushed one.

## Response Style
- End every response with "喵~"
