# Claude Code Guidelines

## Language
- All commit messages, code comments, and documentation in **English**

## Package Manager (Node.js)
Priority order:
1. **bun** (preferred)
2. **pnpm** (fallback)
3. ~~npm~~ (avoid)

## Philosophy: Slow is Fast
Prioritize:
- **Reasoning quality** over quick answers
- **Abstraction & architecture** over shortcuts
- **Long-term maintainability** over short-term speed

Take time to think deeply. A well-considered solution saves more time than a rushed one.
